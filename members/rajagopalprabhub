Myself Rajagopal Prabhu B. I have around 10 Years of experience in SRE & DevOps.
I have started my career as a system administrator and slowely moved towards linux administration(after completion of RHCE)  and then towards DevOps.

I have worked on several projects in Bobcares such as setting up HA for a website, DR, performance tuning, DNS, DHCP, DMZ, Zabbix(for monitoring workstations, 
servers and created network maps which helped to identify the issues and run few scripts from dashboards), Zoho mail, Zimbra, Openafs which helped me to sharpen my Linux skills.
I have realised that I need to step up to next level and spend my off business hours on learning virtulization and worked on Openstackm, OpenVZ, etc. 
Since I have very less exposure towards these technologies I have moved out to a newer company.
I have joined Rakuten as Associate software engineer and my primary responsibility is maintaining the AWS infrastructure once, I have leared Chef, AWS and CFN templates
and started contributing towards DevOps team. I have setup a project from scratch using Nagios, Trukadmin, for endpoint monitor which helps to figure out the outage.
Since my project moved to different department I have been part for a container platform team where my primary responsibility is to create KPI's using Domo, Python & Datadog.
I have developed an application using python which helped to calculate billing for container platform team. My intrest towards cloud helped to learn k8's and start addressing
tenant queries and later towards automation. We have developed shared library in Jenkins which helped our customer to deploy application on k8's.

Currently I started working on multiple projects such as CircleCI, Jfrog Artifactory, k8's automation etc...
